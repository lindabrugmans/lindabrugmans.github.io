        <h1>PONG</h1>
        <h3> Small explanation Project PONG</h3>
        <p> This was one of the first projects that I have made.
            When starting this project I had zero experience with coding, UNITY or any language at all. </p>

        <h3> What was the goal of this project? </h3>
        <p> The purpose of this project was to get to know UNITY and the basics of C#. </p>

        <h3> What have I learned in this project? </h3>
        <p> 1) The basics of UNITY --> How to make a project, create a code, add images and assets. </p>
        <p> 2) A few basic lines of code of the language C#. </p>
        <p> 3) To not give up even when something does not work the way I wanted it to work. </p>

        <h3> Conclusion </h3>
        <p> In this project it felt like I had been thrown into the deep.
            Which was the case, because I had zero experience.
            This is another reason why it felt good to see the end results.
            Because it was a working Pong game, and my first ever project.
