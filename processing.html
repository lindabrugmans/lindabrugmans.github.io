        <h1>PROCESSING</h1>
        <h3> Small explanation Project PROCESSING</h3>
        <p> This project was more creative, because I had to "draw" using Coding.
            For this project the application "processing" was used. </p>

        <h3> What was the goal of this project? </h3>
        <p> There was not really a goal in this project besides learning a bit of java,
            and working with this new application. </p>

        <h3> What have I learned in this project? </h3>
        <p> 1) Basic Java</p>
        <p> 2) That there are more possibilities with coding </p>

        <h3> Conclusion </h3>
        <p> This project was fun to do, but also interesting.
            because I realized that there are several more posilibites with coding.
            This project was also really helpfull because I could see how the whole thing can change,
            by only changing one thing.
