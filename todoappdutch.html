        <h3> Korte uitleg Project TODOAPP</h3>
        <p> Het idee van dit project was om een ToDoApp te maken. Eigenlijk dus een soort planner.
            de bedoeling was dat de gebruiker uiteindelijk 
            And the main purpose of this Application was that the user is able to add or remove tasks incase these were
            finished. </p>

        <h3> What was the goal of this project? </h3>
        <p> Create an application which you can personally use, or just some extra experience with working in UNITY.
        </p>

        <h3> What have I learned in this project? </h3>
        <p> 1) UNITY doesnt have to be for games only </p>
        <p> 2) Basic C# </p>
        <p> 3) Basic UNITY </p>

        <h3> Conclusion </h3>
        <p> This project made me realize that UNITY doesnt have to be for games only.
            The possilibities with UNITY are bigger than I had thought. It was interesting,
            because I also got to work with C# again, but it also made me realize that I personally think working with
            websites is more fun.</p>
